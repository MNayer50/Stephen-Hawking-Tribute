      <li> <strong> 1959 </strong> - Hawking began his university education at University College, Oxford </li>
      <li> <strong> 1962 </strong> - Began graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge </li>
      <li> <strong> 1963 </strong> -Diagnosed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a> and given two and a half years to live </li>

      <li> <strong> 1970 </strong> - Working with Roger Penrose, he showed that Black Holes can emit radiation</li>
      
    <li> <strong> 1974 </strong> - Published his paper entitled <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/248030a0">"Black hole explosions?"</a> which showed that due to quantum effects, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation"> Hawking radiation</a> is released by black holes, causing them to evaporate over time.
      
      <li> <strong> 1977 </strong> - Appointed professor of gravitational physics at Cambridge </li>
      <li> <strong> 1979 </strong> - Appointed  Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge which is a chair founded by in 1663 with money left in will of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Lucas_(politician)">Henry Lucas</a>, who was a member of parliment for the University. The chair was one held by Issac Newton from 1669 to 1702 </li>

      <li> <strong> 2005 </strong> - Argued in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0507171">2005 paper </a> that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox"> information paradox </a> was explained by examining all the alternative histories of universes, with the information loss in those with black holes being cancelled out by those without such loss. </li>
      
      <li> <strong> 2009 </strong> - Held a party open to all, but publicised the party only after it was over, so that only time-travellers could attend. No one showed up. </li>
      
      <li> <strong> 2015 </strong> - Helped launch <a href="https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/">Breakthrough Initiatives</a>, an effort to search for Extraterrestrial life </li>
      
      <li> <strong> 2018 </strong> - Published his final paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FJHEP04%282018%29147"> A smooth exit from eternal inflation?</a> </li>
      
      <li> <strong> 2018 </strong> - Died on March 14, in his home in Cambridge, England on the 139th anniversary of Einstein's birth. His ashes were buried in the Scientist's Corner in Westminster Abbey between the graves of Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton. </li>
